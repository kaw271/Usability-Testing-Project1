 <h1>Field of Study </h1>
  <h2>I am fron the Cleveland area, more specifically Kent, Ohio. It is a college town so not exactly the type of Ohio that people think of aka corn and tractors. My dad owned a restaurant there so I grew up seeing how food brought people together. My immediate family consist of my mom, dad, my younger brother, and my dog Sally. The rest of my family either lives across the U.S. or Taiwan. My parents were very spontaneous growing up, vacations were spent with minimal planning and weekends were spent driving to Columbus or random attractions just because. Besides my family, I don't feel like I have found "my people" yet. I grew up going to many different schools-- public school, an arts middle school and a boarding high school. I've constantly had to adapt to my environment and remake friends. To me, I have been on a train riding through life, meeting people that have come on and off the ride. This is why I love PPW as my major, I can apply it to all kinds of careers and professions. </h2>

  <h2>UX Design, Usability Testing, and product developemnt is Narnia and I am Lucy Pevensie who has just entered through the magic wardrobe. I am extremely intrigued by the human side of Usability Testing but am not sure where I fall within it. Most of my background is in writing narratives for the public and illustrating graphics through commissions and clubs. Perhaps there are transferrable skills from those experiences that can be applied to UX Design.  </h2>

         <h1>Where do you want your knowledge and skills to take you?</h1>
  <h2> I started college planning on going into Public Relations. I was PR Chair for clubs and it was something that came natural to me. However, I was turned off by it after visiting a media company where the employees looked miserable (despite the overexcited tour guide convincing me otherwise). I was looking for more excitement and went into broadcasting. Although the classes and internships I did in broadcasting were beyond fulfilling, I found myself constantly getting sick due to early hours and nonexistent routines in those roles. I realized I actually did crave some sort of structure. This past fall, I got lucky and took an Exhibitions Presentation class. My class curated and gave tours for one of the opening exhibits for the UAG and I fell in love with designing experiences for the visitors. Now, I am seeking opportunities that include marketing, art, and working in-person with clients. Wherever I end up though, I know that I will take away the skill of accessible writing and communication for the public. </h2>
